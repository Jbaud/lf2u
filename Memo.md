A list of challenges you faced while working on this assignment and the solutions you found to those challenges.

    The most challenging part was to follow extacly the I/O specifications of the API.  Writintg the customs serializer/desiarilzer was challenging since it was my first time.
    I also took me some time to create a functional maven project following the requirements.


Recommendations : 

    I believe it would be beneficial for futur students to create Lamp Rest API by themselves as a replacement for HW#3. I think this would allow them to be more prepared about
    the Json parsing and the general API structure.
