Unit test coverage as measured by the tool of choice in your chosen programming language.

    The whole project as a coverage of 72% however the model and controller classes are tested to 89% and 81 %  respectively.
    I had a hard time testing the Rest controller with JerseyTest and as it was mentionned in the FAQ I was not mandatory to test those.

Cyclomatic complexity for your code. Please don't submit code with cyclomatic complexity higher than 20 because you're just wasting your time.

    The maximum cyclomatic complexity is 14.

The number of hours you needed to get the code working.
    
    I can't tell for extacly but  more than 30 hours.

The number of hours you spent preparing your submission.

     2 hours.

A list of challenges you faced while working on this assignment and the solutions you found to those challenges.

    The most challenging part was to follow extacly the I/O specifications of the API.  Writintg the customs serializer/desiarilzer was challenging since it was my first time.
    I also took me some time to create a functional maven project following the requirements.
    To summarize the challenged faced was mostly due to the API and not  in the Plain Old Java Object.


Recommendations : 

    I believe it would be beneficial for futur students to create Lamp Rest API by themselves as a replacement for HW#3. I think this would allow them to be more prepared about
    the Json parsing and the general API structure.
